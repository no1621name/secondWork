# secondWork
Hello, it is my second work for portfolio. 

In fact, this is crm (customer relationship management) for work with data base of client (for example, students of some course). 
For correct operation you need: 
1. download .zip with project; 
2. unpack it in some folder;
3. open console (Win+R => 'cmd') and enter command cd your-path/crm-backend;
4. then enter command 'node index'

Also you have to open index.html with 'Live server'. 

Warning! I have made only frontend (crm-frontend). Other code (crm-backend) I have taken from GitHub.
